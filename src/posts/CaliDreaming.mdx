## The Dream

Well, well, well… This was a big one. Why? My generation, the one my parents belong to, and everyone living in the West, actually, has been shaped by the culture exported from the US—specifically from California. The imaginary world built around such a place is deeply rooted in our identity. But that wasn’t just about tourism. It was time to satisfy the urge to see it with my own eyes and experience sunny California for myself.

This trip wasn’t just about sightseeing; it was about chasing a naive (?) dream shared by many, starting with the Uber driver who picked me up from the airport. The dream was to dive into LA and maybe get lucky—perhaps meet someone who could spot some talent in me or give me a chance to prove my dedication and grit. To land a job or something job related. The idea was to be in the place to be, where stuff happens and to be devoured by it.

As soon as I arrived, I could breathe a different air—it was electrifying. Sure, I was wearing some sugarcoated glasses, but if there’s any place in the world where dreams feel possible, it’s California, or at least, that's how I was feeling. It gave me a "La La Land" vibe, where people exuded energy, where no ideas or approach to life seemed too big or too wild. Their attitude was more like, "Okay dude, it may be crazy, but you’re working on it right? That’s good, keep going, and we’ll see."

## Big Tech Tour

Thanks to some connections and simply spreading the word about my Cali visit, I had the opportunity to meet brilliant people working in tech and media. Thanks to my friend P, I visited Google Playa Vista, a converted hangar that was surely impressive. They told me there was a massive empty room they didn’t know what to do with, so they started organizing challenges to see who could fly paper planes the farthest. Wild.

Thanks to an introduction, I also visited Google's HQ in Mountain View—twice!—and enjoyed two free lunches. It was amusing when I entered the building with L; he greeted a colleague and immediately told me, "That guy landed a rover on Mars." That was the caliber of professionals working there. As I always say, I prefer to be a bush in a sequoia park rather than a palm in the desert.

At HTC in San Francisco, I arranged a meeting—sort of. They stopped replying at some point, so I decided to just ring the bell. It worked, and I had the chance to learn more about what they were doing and see if I might fit in.

And then, Apple! What an amazing piece of architecture their HQ is. It felt like a spaceship that had landed on Earth and was also very secluded. It was not as accessible as the other places. I tried to show up at the entrance, asking if someone might be available to meet me. Without hesitation, they handed me a card. Oh! A business card. What was on it? www.jobs.apple.com. Oh! Silly me! How did I not think of that? Why did I travel 12,000 km when I could have applied from home? Thanks, reception guys, you enlightened me.

Google, HTC, Apple—who was left?


## "Long Time no see!"

Facebook. I had tried and tried for weeks to connect with someone there, but with no luck. Facebook felt insular, but I wasn’t about to give up after traveling 12,000 km. Menlo Park was just 30 minutes by car from where I was staying, so I thought, “Am I giving up? Certainly not!”

I arrived at Menlo Park, parked my yellow Smart car, and jumped on one of the Facebook bikes to start touring the exterior. There were plenty of buildings—so which one was dedicated to Oculus and VR? I asked a valet for some info, and he directed me to Building 18. Nice, I knew the building. But when I reached it, I notice that a badge was required...obviously. I sat on a bench for a while, thinking about my strategy. I quickly jumped on LinkedIn and listed all the employees in Menlo Park, looking for someone who might be less inclined to push me away. Developers? Not really. Busy executives? Nope. Who might be more open to external engagement? The Head of Partnerships! A person constantly interacting outside the studio. And you know what? I’d seen him years before during an event on stage before he started working at Facebook, that was my guy. I had a plan.

Time to enter the building—how? Tailgating. Did I know it was illegal? Genuinely no, I didn't. Did I succeed? Yes.

As soon as I entered, the admin promptly asked me to identify myself. Their tone was rather stern and pointed. So I came up with the oldest excuse: “Oh well, I was passing by and wanted to surprise my friend B. He’s not aware I’m here, but yeah, it was meant to be a surprise.” They were skeptical but asked me to fill out a form and called B. Success!

I sat in the lobby, admiring all the previous iterations of the Oculus headset arranged on a vertical wall. Of course, I was nervous, but I had to find a way to engage with B and maybe land an invite to the upcoming Oculus Connect. At some point, he appeared on the other side of the turnstiles. I started smiling, walked toward him, and said, “B! Long time no see!” He replied, “Long time no see,” with a stunned smile, clearly searching his mental database for who I was. I quickly engaged him, making up a reason why I was there, explaining how we were best friends after that bold demo he gave on stage years ago. I played on the fact that he couldn’t remember me because, after all, you meet tons of people at festivals. My story was credible, and I felt so confident that I assumed he’d give me a tour inside and get a free coffee. But nope, I was pushing it too far. We ended up sitting in the lobby discussing various topics for about 15 minutes. I managed to get his work email, but in the following days, he never replied. It was worth a try. Young me took this tailgating thing a little too lightly, but that’s history now.

## The VC encounter

I also met a pretty big VC I had previously encountered in Milan. He had Italian roots (as 99% of Americans...or this is what they claim), so I played on that. He told me to meet him at a cafe in Palo Alto—a very nice place. We chatted for about 25 minutes, but then I went to the toilet. When I came back, I found two other people already seated in my place, discussing something with him. My time with him was over sooner than expected, and the goodbye was abrupt—actually, not really a goodbye at all. This was one of the most iconic examples of how Americans always have five minutes for you—the famous elevator pitch. They’re opportunistic in the sense that they look for the chicken with the golden eggs everywhere, without preconceptions, and that’s very nice. An equal opportunity for everyone. At the same time, if you don’t meet their expectations in those five minutes, you’re out. No mercy.
