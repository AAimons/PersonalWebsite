            Since its inception, cinema has been deeply entangled with the technical mastery and technological advancements of its time.
            <br /> Among the latest innovation in the Audiovisual (AV) field is Virtual Production (VP), which is an alternative to the established process, whose proponents claim that it fosters creativity while saving time and money. 
            <br />While the VP process is used for advancing high-end productions, little consideration has been bestowed upon small and medium productions (SMPs), which, by definition, have limited economic and human resources. 
            <br />However, according to the <Link href="https://www.wired.com/2004/10/tail/">â€™Long Tailâ€™</Link> concept they are much greater in number, and their market is still very substantial, making it a potential worth to investigate from both an academic and commercial perspective.

I want to spend more words on the PhD journey rather then the research by copyng and pasting what is already available online.
 <br /><br />This PhD was funded by <Link href="https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/27288">StoryFutures</Link> and therefore the output is <Link href="https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/27288">Open Access</Link>. If you are curious, go for it. 
 <br /><br />
Embarking on a PhD can be very tricky. Sooner or later you are going to encounter a number of obstacles and limitations that cannot be overcame (resources, time, politics, limited skills, personal circumstances).
I started during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and this historic event profundly changed my research, my approach to it and, moreover, the overall life experience.
<br /><br /> I think that what you develop as a PhD is the art of adapting to ever changing scenarios. If you want to reach the end of the journey and deliver, you have to define a goal based on many forces that are stretching you around. The goal cannot be clear at first and if it doesnâ€™t appear obvious at a certain point, itâ€™s your responsability to make sense out of it. What do I want to research? What my sponsor wants me to research? What my supervisor wants me to research? How can I enrich the scinetific literature?  What can I actually research?
I could mention even more forces but you got the idea. 
<br /><br /> Itâ€™s easy to be at the mercy of these powers, like being stranded in the ocean. Therefore I came up with a Realistic Intersaction plan that could satisfy these different, sometimes divergent, interests. Itâ€™s a matter of acting to pull off something that may add value to the table. Something that could be doable with the time, resources and skills at my disposal.
A PhD, in most cases, is an individual experience and if you need a hand you will find it at the end of your arm.

        This small book was written with great passion for exploration during a pioneering moment when I believed there could be significant democratization in discovering this new medium. There was much practical experimentation, but few were asking critical questions about why and how to use VR as a means of communication.
            <br /><br />
I initially had five questions when I began this research. By the time I finished writing the book, I had a hundred more in mind. I believe that to find answers, one must first ask the right questions. This book aimed to move in that direction.
<br /><br />
Just as I am fascinated by the semiotics of cinematic language, I wondered if there might be an equivalent approach for VR. Semiotics helps convey certain emotions to the viewer and constructs the narrative more effectively. Therefore, to create impactful VR projects, understanding how to reach viewers was crucial. Today, this falls under the label of UX XR Design, where certain principles are analyzed based on case studies created by artists worldwide who have interpreted this medium in their own ways.

This work was notably recognized by the World VR Forum, which helped turn it into a proper book and included a press conference for its launch. The event, held in collaboration with the wonderful space BASE and supported by my company at the time, Proxima Milano, was a memorable momentâ€”an opportunity for dissemination and to infect others with the same passion for discovery and this new medium.

After many years, the book is no longer available for purchase, but I want it to remain accessible for those who wish to dive into the past. Today, I view it with fondnessâ€”a work that, in many ways, is raw, but which I believe holds historiographical value, capturing the state of affairs in 2015-16-17 that may bring some down memory lane.

                Today, Iâ€™m uncertain whether I would write another book on these subjects. Thereâ€™s an experiential gap that canâ€™t be filled solely through written storytelling or using words. The most effective way to present my critical and educational viewpoint on these matters would involve a multimedia approach, including text, images, videos, and importantly, direct experience with the projects analyzed and the UX XR Design interactions under review. 
                Unexpectedly, I recently retrieved an archaeological find: an old video essay dating back to 2015/2016. I wanted to link it to the text of the book. The essay is a collage of notable projects from that era, mostly available on the DK2 and Google Cardboard. It showcases innovative and clever approaches that demonstrate the creatorsâ€™ intentions to convey meaning and play with this new medium.

An evolution in how I convey my research and critical thoughts on the topic began when I started speaking at public events and conferences. This platform allowed me to enhance my narrative by incorporating images, diagrams, and animated gifs, which better illustrated my analyses.

In 2016, I gave a talk at Voxxed Days Belgrade (the first of many in the following couple of years) to an audience of 200 people. It was like being thrown into the deep end. I vividly remember considering leaving the stage a few times due to anxiety, especially given my very basic English skills at the time. I made it to the end, though, and handled the most difficult part of every talk: the Q&A

            I discovered that sharing my insights and interesting content could grant me access to often pricey or exclusive events. Getting a free pass and sometimes even having my travel and accommodation expenses covered was the perfect plan. However, it wasnâ€™t just about promoting myself. The most important aspect was interacting with others, meeting people, and gaining insights into what they were doing and what was coming next. It became a virtuous circle that further accelerated my professional growth and understanding of the field. It was a fertile ground for a curious individual like me.

            Sometimes projects are halted before they come to fruition, either because the client loses interest, the budget is insufficient, or there are feasibility issues. However, all these inquiries or experimental ideas are very valuable for learning new things and discovering unknown aspects. Even if they remain incomplete and donâ€™t reach the stage of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or POC (Proof of Concept), they are part of the journey and it would be a shame to overlook them.              </ProjectSectionText>
